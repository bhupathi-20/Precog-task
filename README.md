# Precog-task

Dependencies: * Install the dependencies from requirements.txt

Dataset: Please download the dataset from https://hatefulmemeschallenge.com/ 

I have worked in Colab Jupyter notebooks, so if you are working in colab please upload the dataset as it is to your google drive to access the dataset.

If working locally use os module to access the folders and files present in this repository.

Caution: I have marked some text cells as do not run, as they take many hours to run. I have stored the required outputs in other files.
